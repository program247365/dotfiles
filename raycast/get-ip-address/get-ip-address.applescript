script by Phil Stokes

2013
This script will deteremine the IP Addresses of your router, your node on the internal network (aka 'Internal IP') and your public internet IP address (aka 'External IP') and allow you to copy them for use in Terminal or other applications
The script is set to display 'No connection' after a pretty short 3-second timeout. Feel free to increase that at the line in the script after the comment "# CHANGE THE DELAY HEREâ€¦". Just change the number '3' to something longer (the number = seconds). Alternatively,  just keep hitting the 'Try Again' button when the app runs as necessary.
Enjoy!
