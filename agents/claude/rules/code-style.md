# Code Style Rules

- YAGNI: don't build for hypothetical future requirements.
- No premature abstractions. Three similar lines beat a premature helper.
- Keep edits small and focused. Don't refactor surrounding code unless asked.
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change.
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen in practice.
- Prefer boring, stable primitives. Complexity must earn its place.
- Make intent obvious through naming and structure, not comments.
- Code should be readable in six months — by someone unfamiliar with the task.
